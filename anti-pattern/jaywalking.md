Jaywalking antipattern: Instead of creating an intersection table to handle the relationship, development chooses to use a   comma-separated list string to store the relationship between two tables

Example: 
| product_id | product_name| account_id |
|----------|----------|----------|
| 1    | Test produc| 1,10,1  |
